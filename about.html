    <h1>About SensorServer</h1>

    <p>SensorServer is a suite of linux scripts that collect sensor data over
    the internet and display it as digital readouts and plots. It includes
    a cron job that polls Arduinos running a script also called SensorServer.</p>

    <p>The Arduino SensorServer serves http requests to the internet. You can
    watch live data from this small computer <a http=http://98.232.243.25:8082/>live</a>
    with no other intervening computers.</p>

    <p>The Arduino SensorServer collects sensor signals polling devices at a rate of
    about once a second. It supports three kinds of signals:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Analog - Converted to digital by the Arduino.</li>
      <li><a href=http://c2.com/cybords/wiki.cgi?BynaseProtocol>Bynase</a> - Detected by software in SensorServer.</li>
      <li><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Wire>1-Wire</a> - Read using the Arduino OneWire Library.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>SensorServer reports the most recent sample of each signal in response to requests from the internet.
    Responses are formatted as json, a sample of which is shown here:</p>

    <p>The various signals are given codes, a, b, c, for analog, bynase and 1-wire respectively. The numeric part of the code is a combination of the server's ip address and the input pin number for analog and bynase. For 1-wire the code is extracted from an id unique to each 1-wire device.</p>
    <p>The report includes aditional times and counts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>t0 - the time the server has been running in milliseconds.</li>
      <li>t1 - the time since the last signal sample in milliseconds.</li>
      <li>r0 - the number of internet requests served.</li>
      <li>r1 - the number of crc errors talking to 1-wire devices.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The server processes internet requests one at a time, queuing simultainous requests to be processes at the earliest opportunity.</p>
